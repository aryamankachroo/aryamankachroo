# Hi there 👋

I'm **Aryaman Kachroo**, a junior double major in **Computer Science** and **Data Science** at UNC Charlotte. This repository is a collection of my projects, code experiments, and collaborative work across various domains like:

- **Artificial Intelligence** 🤖  
- **Data Science** 📊  
- **Game Development** 🎮  
- **Software Engineering** 💻  

Feel free to explore the projects, contribute, or reach out if you find something interesting. Let’s build, learn, and innovate together! 🌟

## 🌟 I Am Currently Working On  

### 1. **StarDaze: Stargazing Website**  
Created at [HackNC24](https://hacknc.com/), **StarDaze** is a dynamic stargazing platform where users can explore the best locations worldwide to see significant star constellations and discover constellations visible within a 50-mile radius of their location.  

You can find more details, including a video demo and our team contributions, on our [Devpost page](https://devpost.com/software/stardaze).  

#### Key Features and Technologies:  
- **Background Videos**: Used Claude AI to scale and center the video backgrounds on website pages.  
- **Home Page Styling**: ChatGPT helped us add a glow effect to the word **‘Star’** in "Hello Stargazers."  
- **Unique Fonts and Logos**: Leveraged **Google Fonts (Exo 2)** for title and subheadings. The main logo and custom buttons were generated using AI tools like **universe.io**.  
- **Database Integration (In-Progress)**: Designed a MongoDB Atlas database to enable login functionality for users, storing their credentials securely for future use.  
- **Constellation Map**: Used Claude AI to generate data for the map and implemented Mapbox API for location-based constellation markers, with debugging and CSS enhancements supported by ChatGPT.  
- **Learning JavaScript & CSS**: As JavaScript was new to the team, we leveraged ChatGPT and Claude AI to learn and implement features like initializing user location and fetching location data for markers.

**Background Video Credits**:

### 2. **Financial Planner for Pell Grant Recipients**  
This project aims to create an **open-source financial calculator** specifically for students receiving Pell Grants, as there is currently no easily accessible tool available.  

#### Key Features and Goals:  
- **Custom Calculator**: Developing a calculator that accurately computes Pell Grant amounts based on user inputs such as income, dependency status, and educational costs.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designing a straightforward, student-centric interface to ensure ease of use.  
- **Database Integration**: Storing user financial data securely using MongoDB Atlas.  
- **Learning Tools**: Leveraging AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude AI to implement advanced calculations and optimize the user experience.  

This tool will not only provide accurate calculations but will also offer guidance on financial planning for students, helping them better manage their grants and budgets.
